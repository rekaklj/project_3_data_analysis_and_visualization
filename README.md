# Module 14: Data Science Foundations Portfolio Project - Biodiversity in National Parks<br>
This repository contains the material of my portfolio project for Module 14.<br>
The project is part of the 'Data Scientist: Natural Language Processing Specialist' career path of the website [*Codecadamy*](https://www.codecademy.com).<br>
In this project, I analyze and visualize data on animal and plant species, their conservation status, and their number of observations across four American national parks over the course of seven days.<br>
The datasets are provided by the website *Codecadamy*.<br>
<br>
I aim to answer the following research questions:<br>
1. What is the distribution of conservation_status for protected animals?
2. Which category has the highest proportion of species that are protected?
3. Are the category of a species and whether it is protected or not significantly associated with each other?
4. Which animal and plant species have been observed the most in each park?
5. What can we learn about the bears in the parks?<br>
<br>

The repository contains:<br>
- two datasets: `observations.csv`, `species_info.csv` <br>
- the analysis in a Jupyter notebook: `biodiversity.ipynb` <br>
